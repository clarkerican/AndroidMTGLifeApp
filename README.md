# MTG_Life
Originally, this application was developed with friends freshmen year for a Hackathan and managed to win 3rd place.  

The original dream for this application was to connect multiple devices for a Magic the Gathering Life Counter App.  Now that I know more about networking, I decided to return to the app and add the original desired functionality. The Swift life counter on my github can also communicate with this application through the NodeJS Life Counter Server.  

Soon, I hope to add more ways to connect the two applications.
